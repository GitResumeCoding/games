<h5 style="text-align: center;">Thanks for playing and testing individual level&#39;s code for my game.&nbsp;</h5>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">If you are playing after a code refresh and it seems like the old functionality is still there, allow the game to load in your browser completely then hit refresh on your browser to reload the game it should pull the new code from the server.</h5>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">If you are certain it is not pulling the code, open your browser in incognito/privacy mode which forces the code be pulled completely fresh, as if you never ever saw my game code before.</h5>
