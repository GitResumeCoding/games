Eventually I want to add this and then add it to the gitignore file so that it is only localized for each machine on how to do things

--------------
github --> local
-------------
This will sync my repository with the github one by pulling everything into my local games folder
git pull https://github.com/GitResumeCoding/games.git master

-----------------
local --> github
----------------
This will push my local files up to the github repository
git push orgin master 
username git resume  /\ coding
password */\6/\p


-----
this will tell me if the github url link is connected to the folder if it's not then pull it from the wbepage and add it. 

git remote -v

----
to add the url link
git remote add orgin [URL LINK from github webpage]
i.e. for android
git remote add origin https://github.com/GitResumeCoding/android.git
